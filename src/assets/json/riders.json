            "desc":"2004 125 World Champion Andrea Dovizioso has been in MotoGP™ since an incredible rookie season in 2008, where he was top Independent Team rider and fifth overall. His first victory came at Donington in 2009 when riding for Repsol Honda, before the Italian moved to the Ducati Team following a stint with Monster Yamaha Tech 3. A key part of Ducati’s journey back to the top, ‘DesmoDovi’ is one of the hardest to overtake on the brakes – and one of the cleanest competitors in battle. After long seasons of hard work saw the bike more and more competitive and a consistent frontrunner, 2017 saw the Italian challenge for the World Championship down to the wire in Valencia after a stunning six wins across the season. For 2018, he hit the ground running to win the season opener, endured some harder races and then came back swinging - ending the year runner up once again. 2019 began in similar fashion: a win in Qatar. However, a certain Marquez turned up the wick and proved too much for everyone, with Dovizioso claiming nine podiums - including two wins - on his way to P2 in the overall standings for a third year in a row. Both he and Ducati will be hoping 2020 is their year to shine.",

Over the next three years, he achieved six podiums in the intermediate class before moving back to partner Ajo in his Moto2™ team, winning the Championship in 2015 and becoming the first man to successfully defend the Moto2™ crown since its introduction in 2010 when he took the honours again in 2016. The first Frenchman to win more than one World Championship, Zarco moved into MotoGP™ for 2017 and made an impressive debut with three podiums and two pole positions in his rookie year. He stayed with Monster Yamaha Tech 3 in 2018 and took more podiums, ending the season as top Independent Team rider. In 2019 he made the move to Red Bull KTM Factory Racing to become part of the Austrian factory's assault on the premier class. However, after an incredibly difficult opening half the season, Zarco decided to step away from his contract at the end of 2019, but KTM replaced the Frenchman with test rider Mika Kallio from Aragon onwards. Zarco then stepped in for Takaaki Nakagami at LCR Honda Idemitsu for the final three rounds of the season, before a move to Reale Avinita Racing opened up. He'll be a Ducati rider in 2020.",

In 2014 he did not return to the podium and in 2015 he enjoyed a new challenge with Forward Racing on the Forward Yamaha. Bradl experienced a difficult start to the season, only managing to finish in the points twice in the first nine races, with a best-placed finish of eighth at the Catalan GP. After nine races, Bradl was released from his contract at Forward Racing and took on a new challenge by joining the Factory Aprilia Racing Team Gresini for the second half of the season.

He stayed at the squad for 2018 and impressed once again, earning a seat at the factory Ducati Team for 2019. A run of nine-straight top six results saw Petrucci begin his factory career in fine style, with a fairy-tale maiden Grand Prix victory coming his way at Mugello, in between two P3s in Le Mans and Barcelona.

Viñales came third overall, and the struggles continued into 2018. It was the Spaniard who brought Yamaha's longest losing streak to an end, however, as he won in Australia. 2019 started slowly for Viñales, picking up just the solitary podium in the first seven races. However, victory at Assen then put the wheels in motion for a fantastic latter half of the season. Five podiums, including a win in Malaysia, saw Viñales claim P3 in the Championship.

Impressing from the start, Quartararo was on the podium in just his second race. He repeated that in Assen after claiming pole at both Jerez and Le Mans, but unfortunately a late season ankle injury halted his progress. For 2016 he moved to the Leopard Racing team with KTM machinery, and then moved up to Moto2™ in 2017 with Paginas Amarillas HP40.
